## Context

Users need to protect *their own* sensitive paths (personal documents, company
directories) that the built-in S0 secrets floor cannot know about. Today the
nearest tool is a hand-written `deny` regex, which already matches normalized
absolute paths for file tools — but only as a string pattern: it never sees
through bash command strings semantically, and the classifier adjudicating the
gray zone has no idea which paths the user considers sensitive. The measured
record constrains the design space: command-string regexes are obfuscatable
(rule-layer audit, 8/8 bypasses reproduced), and a tree-sitter rule engine was
measured to absorb zero gray calls (rule-engine-sim) — so heavyweight bash
analysis is off the table for this project.

A second constraint is *leakage*: the paths being protected are themselves
sensitive (directory names, project names). Anything injected into the
classifier prompt leaves the machine bound for the model provider.

## Decision

1. Add a `denyPaths` config field: a list of paths the user declares
   protected. It is a **path-semantic declaration** — unlike `deny` regexes
   (string patterns, the user owns the normalization assumptions), the tool
   owns normalization here.
2. **Normalization pipeline (both sides, same scale)**: `expandHome` →
   `path.resolve(cwd, p)` (lexical layer, never fails, handles nonexistent
   paths and glob tokens) → `fs.realpathSync` attempt (enhancement layer:
   resolves symlink indirection such as `ln -s ~/sensitive /tmp/loot`);
   realpath failure degrades to the lexical result. Comparison is per path
   segment (`abs === base || abs.startsWith(base + path.sep)`). denyPaths are
   normalized once at session start; candidate paths per verdict. This mirrors
   the self-protection layer's existing realpath-normalized comparison — the
   helper is shared.
3. **Local extractor as evidence producer, not adjudicator**: file tools
   (read/write/edit/grep/find/ls) contribute their absolute path; bash
   contributes path tokens extracted from the full command string (including
   heredoc bodies, which arrive inline). External script *contents* are
   explicitly not read (no L3): recursion/TOCTOU/obfuscation make soundness
   unachievable, and a partial illusion of coverage would violate the
   project's honest-framing stance.
4. **Hit → deterministic ask (terminal)**, degrading to deny in
   non-interactive modes via the existing ask-degradation rule. The extractor
   never *denies*; it routes the exception back to its owner — the user who
   declared the path. Priority order: self-protection deny → built-in floor
   deny → user deny → **denyPaths hit → ask** → user allow → gray/classifier.
   denyPaths therefore overrides the user's own allow rules ("not even my
   allow list may touch these").
5. **Classifier sees an existence hint only**: a fixed system-prompt sentence
   stating that protected paths are configured and that edge-probing behavior
   (copy-then-read, archiving, indirection) should be judged strictly. No
   path plaintext, ever. Calls that *hit* never reach the classifier at all
   (deterministic ask short-circuits first), so a per-call hit annotation in
   the transcript would be dead code — dropped from the design.
6. denyPaths is **not** controlled by `builtinDenyFloor: false` (that switch
   turns off built-in claims, not the user's own declaration) but is subject
   to the master switch (gate off = no adjudication at all).

## Considered alternatives

- **Hit → classifier discretion (allow/ask/deny possible)**: rejected — a
  user's own security declaration degraded to the input of a probabilistic
  component; one misjudged allow and the content is in context.
- **Hit → deny (consistent with S0 and user deny)**: rejected — kills
  legitimate tasks that genuinely need the file; the user who declared the
  path is exactly the right adjudicator for the exception. S0 stays deny
  because it is an author-vetted, false-positive-tuned generic set.
- **Masked or plaintext path injection into the classifier prompt**: rejected
  — leaks path prefixes for an unreliable model-side comparison; the
  existence hint captures the behavioral value at zero leakage.
- **Deterministic deny layer over bash (L2 as adjudicator)**: rejected —
  obfuscatable string/path matching is the exact posture the security audit
  documented; declarations that can be silently bypassed are worse than
  declarations routed to a human.
- **Recursive script-content scanning (L3)**: rejected — unsound by
  construction (scripts spawning scripts, dynamic eval); a partial
  implementation would advertise coverage it does not have.
- **tool_result-side detection** (pi's post-execution hook could scan result
  content for denyPaths strings): rejected for now — weak detection
  (path-string presence ≠ content leakage), half-leaked results, no scenario
  it covers that extractor + hint do not. Recorded as an idea in the issue
  tracker.

## Consequences

- **S0 deny vs denyPaths ask is a deliberate inconsistency**: the source of a
  declaration determines who owns its exception approval (author-vetted
  generic set → deny; user-declared → ask). README must state this.
- **Coverage has honest holes**: command substitution, base64-embedded paths,
  external script contents produce no hit signal; those fall back to the
  classifier's existence-hint vigilance. This boundary goes in the README's
  limitations section, alongside the self-protection substring precedent
  ("honestly obfuscatable").
- MCP and custom tools bypass the extractor entirely, but their gray-zone
  adjudication carries the existence hint — the bypass surface is reduced,
  not eliminated.
- Config template gains a commented `denyPaths: []` example; `/automode`
  shows the active count; the pipeline diagram and options table update
  accordingly.
- The matched path is UI-only plaintext: it names the path in the local
  confirm dialog (story 6) but never in block reasons or notifications —
  those travel back into the agent context (model provider), so embedding
  the path there would leak the declaration (story 11).
- Entries anchor to the **session cwd** once at session start; per-verdict
  candidates still resolve against the current call's cwd. Mid-session
  symlink creation or cwd drift therefore cannot re-anchor what the
  declaration covers.
- Landed footprint: ~+230 lines (extensions/auto-mode.ts 1046 → ~1200 at
  review time). The "~900-line minimal" positioning no longer holds
  numerically; the README restates it as a deliberate single-file
  constraint rather than a line-count claim.

## Amendment (2026-09-09): subtree-intersection scope for grep/find/ls

Discussion #8803 (comment 18350257) traced — and local reproduction confirmed
(#48) — a bypass of this ADR's core promise. `grep`/`find`/`ls` declare `path`
optional in pi's schema ("default: current directory"), and an omitted path
produced neither a user-rule target nor a denyPaths candidate: the call graded
as a plain rule-layer allow, never reaching denyPaths or the classifier, and a
recursive search of the cwd returned content out of a declared path with no
ask. An explicit `path` pointing at a directory *above* a declaration fared
little better — the one-directional compare (target under base) missed it and
the call fell to classifier discretion.

Two decisions:

1. **A scope tool's effective target includes its search scope.** For
   grep/find/ls an omitted or empty `path` resolves to the cwd for BOTH the
   user-rule target and the denyPaths candidate. User rules therefore apply to
   the resolved cwd as well; priority is unchanged (a user deny on the cwd
   fires before the denyPaths ask).
2. **Comparison is bidirectional for scope tools only**: a hit fires when the
   target is under a base OR a base sits inside the searched subtree
   (declaration under cwd / cwd inside declaration). `read`/`write`/`edit`
   keep single-target one-directional semantics. Bash token extraction is
   unchanged and stays one-directional: a recursive search issued from a
   shell still misses in both spellings — argument-less (cwd default, no
   token at all) or with a parent-directory argument — joining the documented
   extractor holes that fall back to the classifier's existence hint.
   Over-broad asks (e.g. `grep` over `/` with any declaration active) ask —
   the safe direction, consistent with the URL-token precedent.
3. **The tool-name enumeration mirrors pi's closed built-in registry** (it
   shares the `toolKind` dispatch). An agent cannot register tools mid-session;
   a name outside the registry is an MCP/custom tool, which lands in the gray
   zone with the existence hint by design. An incomplete enumeration therefore
   degrades to classifier scrutiny — never to a silent allow: the enumeration
   decides *deterministic ask vs classifier*, not *ask vs pass*. New built-in
   file tools in future pi versions are an existing maintenance point of the
   dispatch, not a bypass of it.

## Boundary note: the verdict audit log (#54)

The zero-plaintext-out promise scopes to data *leaving the machine* or
*flowing into agent context* (reasons, notifies, observability).
`<agentDir>/verdicts/` is a local observation record in the same trust
domain as `pi-verdict.json` itself: records carry full-fidelity plaintext,
including protected-path spellings matched by gray-zone adjudications — the
transcripts already contain path-bearing command text, so redacting the
`detail` field alone would be inconsistent. The directory is denied to agent
reads *and* writes (records contain raw model output — including fail-closed
failures — which must not flow back into agent context as untrusted text),
and it is deliberately **not** part of the IntegrityWatch baseline: the log
legitimately grows with every adjudication, so a snapshot diff would
false-positive as tampering; write-deny on the directory is the actual
bypass prevention.

## Amendment (2026-09-25): self-protection layer removed (ADR-0001)

ADR-0001's self-protection layer — referenced above as the shared
realpath-normalization helper (story 2), as the first link in the priority
chain (story 4: "self-protection deny → built-in floor deny → user deny →
denyPaths hit → ask → user allow → gray/classifier"), as the read/write-deny
on `<agentDir>/verdicts/` (the boundary note above), and as the obfuscatable
substring-matching precedent cited in the consequences — has been removed in
full (see the ADR-0001 final revision). The priority chain today starts at
built-in floor deny; there is no self-protection deny ahead of it, and the
verdicts directory carries no special read/write protection. This ADR's own
decisions (deterministic ask on a denyPaths hit, the existence hint,
bidirectional scope-tool matching) are unaffected — only the passages above
that assumed the now-removed layer's existence are stale.

**Superseded 2026-10-05 by [ADR-0005](0005-self-protection-layer-restored.md):** the layer is restored
(snapshot-free), so the priority chain again starts at the self-protection deny and reads/writes to
`<agentDir>/verdicts/` are denied — the passages this amendment marked stale are current again, except
where ADR-0005 states otherwise.

## Amendment (2026-10-05): kernel-true spelling tier (path-layer review item 10, plan-review F11)

denyPaths compares base forms of **both** the lexical and the kernel-true
spelling (`denyPathForms` gains `baseForms(kernelPath(expanded, cwd))` for
`..`-spellings): omp's file tools return an absolute input verbatim to the
filesystem, so `subLink/../secret` (link → `<root>/protected/sub`) opens
`<root>/protected/secret` while `path.resolve` names `<proj>/secret` — a
lexical-only comparison was a real bypass for a declaration whose base sits
behind a symlinked component. Both sides of the comparison (the anchored
declaration and the candidate) gain the same tier through this one function,
which is what keeps the match sound. The no-ancestor-rebuild rule is
unchanged: the kernel tier adds only the spelling the kernel itself would
open, never a rebuilt form of a nonexistent target (the tier-discipline
regression stays pinned). User-rule path targets take the same tier for
`..`-spellings, with asymmetric semantics: deny matches when **any** target
matches, allow only when **every** target matches — an allow regex that
matches only the lexical spelling must not allow the call.

## Amendment (2026-10-05): transcript redaction of past tool calls (path-layer review item 6b, plan-review F10/F5)

Past tool calls carried protected-path plaintext into every model payload built
from the session branch: `collectTranscriptParts` sends each prior
`toolCall`'s line to the classifier (and to the EXPLAIN-GATE role, whose
transcript also goes to a model provider) unfiltered — a protected read the
user *approved* leaked its path on every later verdict, against this ADR's
zero-plaintext commitment. Both payloads are now scrubbed through one shared
predicate (`redactorFor(cwd, anchoredBases)`, threaded through
`buildTranscript` → `collectTranscriptParts` → every classifier/EXPLAIN-GATE
caller — F10):

- **Two checks, either one redacts**: the structured tool-access extraction
  (known or unknown tool — `toolAccess`'s `reads`/`writes`, tested through the
  same `denyPathForms` dual-form set a live `denyPaths` comparison uses) and the
  raw JSON of the arguments containing any base's spelling (absolute, `~/`,
  `$HOME`/`${HOME}` — the bash tokeniser knows only `$HOME`, never `${HOME}` —
  or the home-relative tail such as `.ssh/`, in both literal and `cwd`-resolved
  spellings so a relative declaration still catches an absolute spelling).
- **Redact-then-truncate** (plan-review F5a): the check runs on the structured
  arguments *before* `transcriptSafe` caps the line — a path cut at the 600/400
  boundary would otherwise evade every base form. A hit replaces the whole line
  with the fixed marker `<protected-path>`, a neutral privacy marker rather than
  an injection framing (plan-review F9). Over-redaction is transcript-only and
  explicitly accepted; under-redaction would be the leak, so the conservative
  direction is wholesale.
- **Recorded residual** (plan-review F5b): detection is literal and inherits
  this ADR's own documented obfuscation holes — a protected path behind command
  substitution, base64, or an archive is not redacted, because redaction sees
  only what the extractor's token scan and the raw-JSON check already see. The
  classifier's existence hint remains the backstop for exactly those calls
  (which is why item 3 of this phase adds no new prompt text).
- **User messages are deliberately not redacted** (plan-review F5c): a user
  disclosing their own protected path in their own message is theirs to give;
  only past tool calls — the machine-generated residue of an approved action —
  are scrubbed.

Audit records stay local + full-fidelity (the boundary note above is
unchanged: they never leave the machine, so their `actionLine`/`transcript`
fields keep the plaintext the classifier prompt now redacts).
